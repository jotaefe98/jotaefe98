# Hi, There!

I'm Juan Canales, backend focused software developer. I design and build complete applications end to end, but my main interest and strength lie in backend systems, APIs, and core business logic.

## About Me

I started my journey as a programmer in 2022. I hold a Higher Technician Diploma in Computer Science obtained in Spain. Since then, software development has become a real passion for me: for the first time, I’m not limited to searching for tools that fit my needs, I can build them myself.

I naturally gravitate towards backend development, but building my own products has required me to be full-stack, from database design and APIs to frontend and deployment. This has given me a realistic understanding of how systems behave in production.

I stay curious about new technologies, architectures, and efficient ways to build and ship web and mobile applications.

- Room based system with multiple participants
- Real time client–server communication using **WebSockets**

- Monthly, visual shift calendar
- Color coded palette to instantly identify workdays
- Built with **Angular** and **PrimeNG**
- Local first approach for fast access and offline usage
- Optional Google OAuth2 login

### 🚗 BlaBlaCoche

- Centralized ride and seat management
- Clear overview of drivers, passengers, and availability
- Reduced coordination noise

### ⚙️ Bulk-Project (Work in Progress)

Born from a personal frustration: my trainer sends Excel files for workout tracking, which is terrible to fill out on a phone at the gym. I realized this is a common pain point in the coach-athlete relationship. So I decided to build a dedicated mobile app that streamlines communication and workout management between coaches and their athletes.

Beyond solving a technical problem, this project is my opportunity to experience the full product lifecycle firsthand: from development to marketing, sales, and lead generation. I want to understand how to position and sell a product in a real market environment.

- Backend built with **Java 17 and Spring Boot**
- Layered architecture (entities, repositories, services, controllers)
- Authentication and authorization implemented
- API exposed via **Swagger UI**
- Connected to a relational database
- Deployed on a free tier environment (cold start up to ~50 seconds)

🌐 https://demo-backend-bp.jotaefe.net/

> Frontend currently in early development using **React Native**.  
> Planned release on **Google Play** and **App Store**, including paid features.
